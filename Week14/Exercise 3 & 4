LAB 14 — EXERCISE 03 + EXERCISE 04 (SAME SHEET)


-----------------------------------------
EXERCISE 03 — TEST CRUD OPERATIONS (cURL)
-----------------------------------------
1) GET all users (should be [] if empty)
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users

2) POST create a user
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/users \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Alice Johnson","email":"alice@example.com","age":28}'

3) GET again (should include Alice)
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users

4) Persistence test (stop server, restart, then GET again)
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users


EXERCISE 04 — EXTEND FUNCTIONALITY (PUT + DELETE)

5) PUT update a user (update user with id=1)
   curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Alice Updated","email":"alice@example.com","age":29}'

6) DELETE a user (delete user with id=1)
   curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1

7) Confirm delete (GET should no longer show id=1)
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users



EXPECTED users.txt FORMAT (JSON LINES)

After creating 2 users, users.txt should look like:

{"id": 1, "name": "Alice Johnson", "email": "alice@example.com", "age": 28}
{"id": 2, "name": "Bob Smith", "email": null, "age": 30}
